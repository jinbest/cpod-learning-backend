        <p>Buyer agrees to pay the Purchase Price of the Goods as posted on this website attached hereto.</p>

        <h2>3. Payment Terms</h2>

        <p>All subscriptions automatically renew, therefore ChinesePod will charge the subscription fees directly to your credit card after every billing cycle (unless you cancel the subscription - see below for more details on cancellation terms). ChinesePod will charge the subscription fees on the same day of the month each time your subscription comes due. You may cancel recurring subscriptions at anytime.

After cancellation, ChinesePod will discontinue billing for this particular subscription. It is your sole responsibility to completely and fully cancel this payment cycle. Email requests for cancellation cannot be guaranteed or construed as proof of cancellation.</p>

        <p>ChinesePod does not provide account suspension or extension to subscription products.</p>

        <h2>4. Delivery</h2>

        <p>After a subscription is purchased, a student can download lesson materials provided by their subscription until the expiry date of the subscription.</p>

        <p><a name="refund-policy"></a></p>

        <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>

        <p><em>Subscriptions</em></p>

        <p>You may cancel any purchase of a subscription and request a full refund from ChinesePod LLC for any reason within the first 30 days following the FIRST purchase made on the account. If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to ChinesePod LLC will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription via your account page before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service.</p>

        <p>Failure to cancel an account before your due date will result in ChinesePod charging your account. Payments are NON-REFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. However, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.</p>

        <p><em>Tutoring</em></p>

        <p>All prices related to the tutoring service are subject to change by ChinesePod LLC at any time, without notice and without liability to you. ChinesePod LLC does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or a promotional offering.<br>
          <br>
          All tutoring plans are subject to automatic renewal. If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to ChinesePod LLC will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription via your account page before the end of the current subscription period. Failure to cancel a tutoring plan subscription before your due date will result in ChinesePod LLC charging your account.<br>
          <br>
          Students can apply for a partial refund if they wish to terminate the tutoring service before the plan expiry date. Refunds will be provided at the sole discretion of the company. Refunds will be determined by the numbers of used subscription months and used lesson credits. A subscription month is used as long as the plan is active in a subscription cycle regardless of the number of days you actually use the service. A credit is used if you use it to book and take a lesson with a teacher.<br>
          <br>
          Please note the first month of any classes cannot be refunded. Refund amounts will not exceed the amount of the subscription plan purchased. Promotional deals and add-on credits are nonrefundable.<br>
