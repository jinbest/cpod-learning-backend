      <p class="text-left my-3"><span class="font-weight-bold">ChinesePod Recap App</span> (currently in Beta) offers access to short review segments based on full-length ChinesePod lessons. These are aimed explicitly at solidifying previously studied material and extend long-term retention. These lessons come in <span class="font-weight-bold">90-second, 3-minute, and 6-minute intervals</span> (where available) and capture essential points of each lesson. Select the recap length that most suits your current time constraints and jump right in. Recap lessons are specifically focused on your personal ChinesePod study history and will offer only one lesson at a time.</p>
